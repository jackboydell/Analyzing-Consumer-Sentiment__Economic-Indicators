# Analyzing-Consumer-Sentiment__Economic-Indicators

This machine learning project builds on the foundational business concepts of consumer-centric organizations and the smart consumer model to explore the classification/predictive power of consumer sentiment when it comes to changes in unemployment and interest rates.   
Questions: 
Can the idea of a “smart consumer” be extended to general economic indicators like unemployment and interest rates?
Do consumer’ opinions and sentiment provide insight into being able to classify the change in unemployment and/or interest rates in a years time?
