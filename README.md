# Analyzing-Consumer-Sentiment__Economic-Indicators

Business activities are consumer driven as top performing organizations make it a priority to satisfy their consumers’ desires. This machine learning project builds on the foundational business concepts of consumer-centric organizations and the smart consumer model to explore the classification/predictive power of consumer sentiment when it comes to changes in unemployment and interest rates. In addition, the implementation of anomaly detection identifies instances of consumer responses that deviate from common patterns and might require closer analysis into specific causes. 

Questions: 
Can the idea of a “smart consumer” be extended to general economic indicators like unemployment and interest rates?
Do consumer’ opinions and sentiment provide insight into being able to classify the change in unemployment and/or interest rates in a years time?

Data comes from the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. The Consumer Sentiment Index from the University of Michigan is one of the most used consumer sentiment indexes in the country. 

Techniques/approaches: 
(SQL) data manipulation, multiple joins, importing/exporting with CSVs, table creation
